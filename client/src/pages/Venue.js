              Cascade Mountain Ranch is a 50-acre ranch nestled in its own
              private valley in Southern Oregon and surrounded by wilderness
              lands. Hiking/walking trails lead you throughout the ranch. The
              mountains rise on all sides, accented by Grand King Mountain Ridge
              to the east. One can hike to the Lucky Queen Mines or enjoy the
              view with pine, fir, madrone, oak and cedar trees lacing the
              entire panorama.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wild Goose Lake is home to just thatâ€”wild geese! Deer, wild
              turkeys, squirrels and, on rare occasions, elk can be seen roaming
              the Ranch. There are no dangerous animals, snakes, etc.
              Seasonally, the sound of Lucky Miner's Creek can be heard. Guests
              are encouraged to walk, hike or bike the entire 50 acres with a
              map of the trails with estimated distances. Over 30 miles of back
              roads are next door to the ranch for ATVs and motorbikes. Prior to
              becoming a retreat center in 2008, Cascade Mountain Ranch was a
              children's residential group home for 15 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              The peaceful, rural setting provided a great place for kids to be
              nurtured in a stable environment while learning basic skills and
              the strong work ethic associated with living in the country. After
              extensive renovations and upgrades the newly transitioned Ranch
              now serves as a unique wilderness location with guest
              accommodations for retreats, getaways, family reunions, church
              functions, youth groups, weddings and other special events. Groups
              and families are invited to enjoy the peaceful outdoors and
              comfortable lodges.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Ranch is run by iCare, Inc., a non-profit organization that
              helps and supports various specialized needs of families and
              children. Cascade Mountain Ranch is operated solely by volunteers.
              Please help us care for this special place.
